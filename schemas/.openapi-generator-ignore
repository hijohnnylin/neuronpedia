# OpenAPI Generator Ignore File
# This file works for both inference and autointerp clients (Python + TypeScript)
# Patterns use ** for recursive matching across any directory structure

# CI/CD files that we don't want in client packages
**/.gitlab-ci.yml
**/.travis.yml
**/git_push.sh

# GitHub workflows directories (if any get generated)
**/.github/

# Useless empty test stubs (no actual test logic)
**/test/

# Testing configuration files (no useful tests to run)
**/tox.ini
**/test-requirements.txt

# Redundant packaging files (keep pyproject.toml for Poetry consistency)
# Note: Keeping setup.py for installation compatibility with auto-generated README
**/requirements.txt
**/setup.cfg

# Note: .openapi-generator/ directory cannot be ignored - contains generator metadata
